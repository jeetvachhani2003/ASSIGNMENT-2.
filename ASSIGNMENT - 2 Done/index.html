                    <h2>SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL</h2>
                    <p>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (Gujarati: ISO: Vallabhbhāī Jhāvērabhāī Paṭēl; 31 October 1875 15
                        December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was an Indian independence activist
                        and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947
                        to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant role
                        in the Indian independence movement and India's political integration. In India and elsewhere,
                        he was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the
                        Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. </p>
                    <P>Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside of the state of
                        Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants,
                        he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil
                        disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat.
                        He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. Under the chairmanship of
                        Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy" resolution was passed by the Congress. Patel's
                        position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934
                        onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based
                        at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central
                        Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934
                        elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of
                        1936. While promoting the Quit India Movement. Patel made a climactic speech to more than
                        100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that
                        Patel's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical
                        of the proposed rebellion. Patel's organising work in this period is credited by historians with
                        ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.</P>
                    <p>As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for
                        partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace.
                        Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565
                        self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian
                        Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 30). Patel, together with Jawaharlal Nehru and Louis
                        Mountbatten persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.</p>
